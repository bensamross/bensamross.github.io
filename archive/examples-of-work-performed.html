    <h1>Past work...</h1>
    <h2>Develop custom software to operate high performance hardware for advanced environmental research</h2>
    <p>Cutting edge hardware setups require custom software to control the functionality of all the systems exactly as desired. I have been solely responsible for designing the interface, underlying algorithms, and interconnectivity of a software package that works. Built with modern methods and a range of programming languages.</p>
    <h2>Engineer an automated cloud management solution for large volumes of critical data</h2>
    <p>Clients of tecHoney commonly have terabytes of data stored locally (in some cases on loose hard drives in a drawer!). I have written and used a few straightforward data migration scripts that help to move these data from local systems to the cloud in a seamless way that reduces impact to the users. Drivers for uploading data are reduced costs and significant security improvements.</p>
    <h2>A subsidence model of the Condamine Alluvium using remote sensing calibration</h2>
    <p>Wrote scripted downloads and semi supervised processing for very large volumes of Sentinel-1 InSAR data in an attempt to monitor long term vertical ground motion influenced by groundwater associated gas extraction. The tasks were a hybrid of python and ArcGIS bulk data handling and the data are still part of ongoing research.</p>
    <h2>Hybrid cloud integration of key data assets to increase accessibility</h2>
    <p>Made key themed group data assets less disorganised and more readily available by procuring and creating a cloud architecture system. Then configuring and uploading those assets to the system so non-local processing can be performed. Resulting in significant computing time savings.</p>
    <h2>Prototype development of a thermal imaging system to detect asset damage</h2>
    <p>Field tested a prototype drone mounted thermal camera to calibrate a calculated model, aimed at detecting minor changes in ground surface temperature. As a means of locating piped water leaks that have no surface expression. Calibrations were performed with processed GPR data and GPS located utility detection.</p>
    <h2>Hydrographic survey of a river and harbour for flood control</h2>
    <p>Undertook a hydrographic survey of roughly 80km of river to quantify the risk of flooding and bank erosion in a low lying urban environment. Additional baythmetric survey works were performed on the river mouth to evaluate sediment load and coordinate dredging.</p>
    <h2>4-dimensional modelling of the Wellington Port capturing earthquake damage</h2>
    <p>Undertook laser scanning and asset digitisation over a term of 2 years to evaluate changes in soil deformation around the port of Wellington. Resulting in a comprehensive integrated point cloud model. Additional tasks included remote video logging of sub-surface trenches and pipes.</p>
    <h2>Installation of groundwater bores to improve community resilience</h2>
    <p>Community three waters resilience needs to be improved by investment in resilience infrastructure like groundwater bores and minituarised water treatment stations. The placement and installation of these bores was partially supervised by myself. Including groundwater modeling in the affected area and bore logging for archival.</p>
